# Roadmap

The next features we're looking into developing are:

## UI Improvements

* More details on item view, see #12
* "BOM view" allow GET requests with several items, see #24

## Federation

Enable a Installations to link to each other, so users can search for items across them.

* A field must be added to the Items to enable/disable the Item availability on the faderation
